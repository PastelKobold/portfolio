            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Sarah Webster, a recent Computer Science graduate with a passion for software development and problem-solving. Throughout my studies, I honed my skills in C++, Python, JavaScript, and many other core concepts to Computer Science. I’m eager to apply my technical expertise in both backend and front-end development while continuing to grow and learn. Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring creative outlets like music and art, which influence my approach to problem-solving. I’m excited to start my professional journey and contribute to impactful software projects.</p>

                <h3>To The Mewn</h3>
                <p>"To The Mewn" is a game inspired by Cookie Clicker, developed during CatHacks IX, a 24-hour hackathon. Built using the Phaser 3 framework, the game features engaging mechanics and smooth gameplay. I contributed to the back-end development and all visual design was done by me, creating an experience that is both fun and visually appealing.</p>

                <h3>Human Domino Effect Website</h3>
                <p>For my UK senior project, my group and I worked with the "Human Domino Effect" team to help get their website live.
                    Specifically, we worked on a shopping page and a forum. Currently, I'm converting the project to work with Netlify so that the website can become live.
